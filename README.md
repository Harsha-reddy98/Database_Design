# Database_Design Car Rental Company

WOW (World On Wheels) has many locations at various airports, towns, and cities in the United
States. With growth of the business and to efficiently manage its business, WOW intends to
convert its file system base data management to sophisticated centralized database system. With
the rules that the business team of WOW provided, the respective model was made.Built a
front-end framework based on that model using Django.

I utilized Django to create a web-based application on MySQL database that runs in auto-
commit mode. In other words, Django seemed like a good option because of its automatic admin
interface. It reads meta data from our models to provide quick, model centric interface where
trusted users can manage content on our site. Django gives a data-abstraction API when models
are created to create, update, retrieve and delete (update) objects. In Django, the admin’s
recommended use is limited to an organization’s internal management tool and because of this
feature Django proves to be a good framework to use.

The business performance readily improves as it became easier to keep track of customers and
their details. The framework was made in a way that would help the superuser have admin
access, which in this case could be the manager of WOW, who could overlook the track record
of his employees as well as customers. The framework also helps with keeping the invoices in
check. In a nutshell, with a better schema, better framework, business performance becomes
better by multiple folds.
